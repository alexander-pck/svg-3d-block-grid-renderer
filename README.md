# svg-3d-block-grid-renderer
Interactive SVG 3D Block Grid â€” a single-file orthographic renderer that visualizes configurable cube grids. Rotate with theta/phi, adjust size, spacing and opacity. Screen-space brackets annotate Width, Height and Depth; supports visual markers for large dimensions and live controls for quick experimentation. Easy to embed and modify for demos.
